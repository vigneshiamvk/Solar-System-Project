# Solar-System-Project
Thanks for dropping by.

This is a Unity Project where I explore Unity's physics and procedural generation systems to build a small solar system complete with orbiting celestial bodies, different terrains and atmosphere. This repository will be updated as and when I make progress.

To view the scripts I've written, please navigate to **Assets -> Scripts** folder and find the C# (.cs) files. The other files are generated by Unity.

Currently, the solar system has a central star orbited by 3 planets. The 3rd planet has a tiny moon as its natural satellite. You can take a look at the current state of the project using the GIF below, or just clone the repository and run it on your machine.
